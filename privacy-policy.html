            <h3>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
            <p>
              We collect information in two ways: through your own disclosure
              while using the Services, and automatically through our
              technology.
            </p>

            <h4>Personal information you disclose to us</h4>
            <p>
              In Short: We collect personal information that you provide to us
              such as name, address, contact information, passwords and security
              data, and payment information.
            </p>

            <p>
              We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us
              when registering at the Services expressing an interest in
              obtaining information about us or our products and services, when
              participating in activities on the Services or otherwise
              contacting us.
            </p>

            <p>
              The personal information that we collect depends on the context of
              your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make
              and the products and features you use. The personal information we
              collect can include:
            </p>

            <p>
              <li>
                Personal information that you provide, such as your full name,
                current address, phone number, email address, financial
                information (such as bank account number and routing number),
                income and giving levels, and other similar data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Login Credentials. We collect passwords and similar security
                information used for authentication and account access.

                or Savings) are stored by our partner, Stripe and/or Plaid. You
                may find their respective privacy policies at
                https://stripe.com/privacy and https://plaid.com/legal/.
              </li>
            </p>

            <p>
              All personal information that you provide to us must be true,
              complete and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to
              such personal information.

            </p>

            <p>

              or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your
              specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may

              browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
              preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location,
              information about how and when you use our Services and other
              technical information. This information is primarily needed to
              maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our
              internal analytics and reporting purposes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies
              and similar technologies. We collect devices, tools and protocols,
              such as IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, cookie identifiers, or
              others such as the ones used for analytics and marketing, device’s
              geolocation, and other similar data.
            </p>

              a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
              tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this
              policy will require us keeping your personal information for
              longer than 1 year past the termination of the user’s account.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
              personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or,
              if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
              information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
              securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
              further processing until deletion is possible.
            </p>

            <h3>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
            <p>
              In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a
              system of organizational and technical security measures.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational
              security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
              information we process. However, please also remember that we
              cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although
              we will do our best to protect your personal information,
              transmission of personal information to and from our Services is
              at your own risk. You should only access the services within a
              secure environment.
            </p>

            <h3>8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>
            <p>
              In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to
              children under 18 years of age.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under
              18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are
              at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor
              and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we
              learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of
              age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take
              reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.
              If you become aware of any data we have collected from children
              under age 18, please contact us via
              https://fightforfair.org/support.
            </p>

            <h3>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
            <p>
              In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any
              time.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe
              we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also
              have the right to complain to your local data protection
              supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here:
              http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you would at any time like to review or change the information
              in your account or terminate your account, you can contact us via
              https://fightforfair.org/support.
            </p>

            <p>
              Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or
              delete your account and information from our active databases.
              However, some information may be retained in our files to prevent
              fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations,
              enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with legal requirements.

              link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the
              details provided below. You will then be removed from the
              marketing email list — however, we will still need to send you
              service-related emails that are necessary for the administration
              and use of your account. To otherwise opt-out, you may contact us
              via https://fightforfair.org/support.

            <h3>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
            <p>
              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
              applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you
              can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
              about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No
              uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
              signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond
              to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
              communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
              for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
              we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
              this privacy policy.
            </p>

            <h3>11. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
            <p>
              In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are
              granted specific rights regarding access to your personal
              information.
            </p>
            <p>
              California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine
              The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to
              request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge,
              information about categories of personal information (if any) we
              disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the
              names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared
              personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.
              If you are a California resident and would like to make such a
              request, please submit your request in writing to us using the
              contact information provided below.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a
              registered account with the Services, you have the right to
              request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the
              Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using
              the contact information provided below, and include the email
              address associated with your account and a statement that you
              reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly
              displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may
              not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.
            </p>

            <h3>12. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</h3>
            <p>

              compliant with relevant laws.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated
              version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the
              updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If
              we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you
              either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by
              directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review
              this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are
              protecting your information.
